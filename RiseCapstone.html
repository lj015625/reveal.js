            <p>In Nov 2020 I had opportunity to lead a team with five team members,
                and mentor two Data Scientists from another team to develop my leadership skills.
                In my "Rise" Capstone project I wanted to focus on: </p>

                    <small>Before I started session one my manager wants me to focus on "give critical feedback" and
                            "leading discussions" skills.
                        I found giving Critical feedback is easier using <a
                            href="https://www.amazon.com/New-One-Minute-Manager-ebook/dp/B00MMG19OG">"One Minute Redirect"</a>
                        technique:</br>
                        Give Redirect as soon as possible.
                        When I meet with one of my direct report I confirm the facts, review the mistake together (be
                        specific).
                        Express how I feel about the mistake's impact on result. Then be quite on a moment to allow the
                        person to feel
                        concerned about it. Then tell them they are better than mistake, I think well of them in person,
                        I still have confidence in them. Critical feedback using Redirect kept our project on track.

                        After Rise session I had a opportunity to mentor two Data Scientists outside our group. Both of
                        them are in Consulting org and their group.  We have monthly recurring meetings.
                        I showed them the work CI group is doing and encourage them to find a suitable
                        ML project using a existing dataset the have access to.
                        They both found a interesting projects to explore. I frequently used coaching
                        in our monthly meetings. Besides sharing useful resources and knowledge,
                        I asked a lot of thought-provoking questions to get them motivated.

                        over the person's desk to talk about issues and draw on the whiteboard to make it clear.
                        I challenged myself to speak up in many of our group's
                        weekly virtual syncs to share knowledge, experience, and ask questions.
                        Our team's collaboration increased this year even comparing to
                        last year when we were meeting face-to-face. We learned many things from each other.
                        Several times other team reach out to us to work together after our weekly syncs.
