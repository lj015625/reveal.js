            <p>In Nov 2020 I had opportunity to lead a team with five team members,
                I also mentor two Data Scientists from another org.  This is also an opportunities to develop my leadership skills.

                    <small>Before I started Rise one my manager wants me to focus on "give critical feedback" and
                            "leading discussions" skills.  Giving critical feedback is challenging to me.
                        But I found giving Critical feedback is easier using <a
                            href="https://www.amazon.com/New-One-Minute-Manager-ebook/dp/B00MMG19OG">"One Minute Redirect"</a>
                        technique:</br>
                        Give Redirect as soon as possible.
                        When I meet with one of my direct report I confirm the facts, review the mistake together (be
                        specific).
                        Express how I feel about the mistake's impact on result. Then be quite on a moment to allow the
                        person to feel
                        concerned about it. Then tell them they are better than mistake, I think well of them in person,
                        I still have confidence in them. I have used this technique.
                        Critical feedback with Redirect helps developing my team and keeping our project on track.

                        After Rise session I had a opportunity to mentor two Data Scientists outside our group. Both of
                        them are in Consulting org and doing different kind of work.  We have monthly recurring meetings.
                        I showed them the work CI group is doing and encourage them to find a suitable
                        ML project using any existing dataset the have access to.
                        They both found a interesting projects to explore. I frequently used coaching
                        in our monthly meetings. Besides sharing useful resources and knowledge,
                        I asked a lot of thought-provoking questions to get them motivated.

                        over the person's desk to talk about issues and draw on the whiteboard.
                        I challenged myself to ask questions in many of our group's
                        weekly virtual syncs and share knowledge, experience.
                        Our team's collaboration increased this year even comparing to
                        last year when we were meeting face-to-face. We learned many things from each other.
                        We also found sharing code on Github is much better.  Our team's use of Github went up.  At this point
                        our team prefer to conduct our three weekly syncs over Team than face-to-face.

                        and organize team virtual event. This is harder to measure but necessary for the long term success and retentions.

                        The note will document problem solved and outstanding issues. The note is also a place to organize
                        knowledge and tasks at hand. I also have better understanding any problems they have.  I can be
                        more proactive to address any problems.

                 <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                     <p>2020 is very challenging year and very tough to find free time.
                         I think Rise give me dedicated time to develop leadership skills.  Leadership skills is very
                     different from technical skills but absolutely necessary to help my team and I achieve goals.
                         I want to thank my manager, Rise facilitator, executive speakers,
                     and other Rise participants for the opportunity of growth.</p>
